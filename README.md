## About QuestionList

This is a project where the main feature in fetch data from an API (RESTful) and feed an UITableView, this app also allow the user filtrate and share the content, when the user click on the cell a detail screen is shown and it can vote on one of the itens and also share that item. 
I made a singleton Timer to run during the project and detect if the internet connect is valid, if it lost a connection a custom alert view is presented and dismissed if the internet connection turn on again.
